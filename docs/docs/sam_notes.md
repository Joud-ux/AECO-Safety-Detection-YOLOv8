# SAM Exploration Notes 
Segment Anything Model (SAM) was used in Roboflow as an AI assisted annotation tool to speed up the labelling process of construction activities.
## What Helped
SAM helped reduce annotation time by automatically detecting object boundaries after selecting the target area. It was particularly useful in images where construction elements had clear edges and visible boundaries, such as reinforcement cages. 
SAM was also effective in detecting construction machinery with well-defined shapes, such as concrete mixer trucks and excavators, where the object edges were clear and easy to identify. The tool made the labeling process faster compared to drawing bounding boxes manually.
## What Failed
SAM performance was weaker when construction activities did not have clearly defined boundaries. In some excavation images, the transition between soil and working areas was not always clear, which caused inaccurate selections.
Under harsh weather conditions, especially in foggy environments, SAM sometimes struggled to correctly detect the object because the visibility was reduced. This resulted in incomplete or incorrect selections that required manual correction.
SAM also had difficulty when there was material overlap, such as steel reinforcement partially covered by concrete, where the model could not clearly distinguish between the two materials.

## Annotation Examples 
Annotation 1 – Excavator Detection (SAM)
SAM successfully detected the excavator because it has clear boundaries and a defined shape. The excavation ground required manual adjustment.

Annotation 2 – Excavation Area (Manual Annotation)
This excavation area was labeled manually because SAM could not clearly detect the boundaries of the soil.

Annotation 3 – Concrete Slab Detection (SAM)
SAM successfully detected the concrete slab because it has clear and defined boundaries.

Annotation 4 – Excavation Detection Failure (SAM Limitation)
SAM detected the excavator but failed to detect the excavation area due to unclear soil boundaries and difficult conditions.

Annotation 5 – Concrete and Steel Overlap (SAM + Manual Editing)
SAM detected the concrete surface well, but manual editing was required where steel reinforcement overlapped with concrete.
